# readability-score-tester-ts
This is a python app that takes a multi-line input, filters out code, and generates a readability score based on Flesch-Kincaid tests. The higher the score, the easier it is to read and understand your document.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:alexneri/readability-score-tester-ts.git`
2. Open terminal.
3. Navigate to the folder.
3. Enter command `python main.py`. If you are using Python 3, use `python3 main.py`
4. Paste text into the terminal.
5. Enter two empty lines (double Enter/Return) to signify the end of the input.
6. Wait for the computation to be shown.
7. If you want to analyze a new text, enter `yes`.
